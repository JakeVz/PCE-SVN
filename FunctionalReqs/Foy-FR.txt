The system will catalog and display student written reviews about classes and 
provide a rating system (out of 5 stars) based on workload, difficulty, how 
much they learned, as well as their final letter grade.

The system will show the average of both the student provided scores and their 
final grade, as well as a list of all the teacher who have taught the class 
with their Polyratings scores.

The system will include at the top of the page a numbered rank specific only 
for that class department, based on how many reviews have been submitted for 
the class and the scores provided by students, with higher ranks meaning the 
class is popular with students.
