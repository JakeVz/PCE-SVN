1. As a student, I want to see the ratings given to my future courses by students who have taken them, so that I can have a better idea of what classes are like.
2. As a student, I want to see how much work each class is, so that I can plan my schedule more effectively.
3. As a teacher, I want to see what anonymous feedback students have, so that I can improve my teaching methods to help future students learn better.
