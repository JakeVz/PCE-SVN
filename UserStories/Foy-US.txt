As a student, I want to be able to provide and read feedback about students’ 
experiences with certain classes at Cal Poly, so all students can be better 
prepared for required classes and know which technical elective or GE classes 
are good for my college experience.

As a teacher, I want to be able to see which of the classes I teach are 
successful in a student’s education and which ones need improving, so I can 
work with my peers that also teach these classes to improve both the material 
and the teaching we provide for the students.

As an administrator, I want to be able to see which classes in my department 
are popular or unpopular with students, so that I can make sure there are more 
sections of popular classes provided each quarter and seek ways to either 
improve or cut unpopular classes.
