As a student, I want to know other students' options about a class, so that I 
have a base of anecdotal knowledge about it.

As a reviewer, I want to provide my honest opinion, so that readers can use my 
experience to influence their decision.

As a statistician, I want to compile an average rating of each class, so that
I can see which one of a certain category has the highest rating.
